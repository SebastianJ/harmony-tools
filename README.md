Scripts and tools for Harmony.one


## build.sh
build.sh is a custom build script that compiles the harmony + hmy binaries using the master branches from harmony-one/harmony and harmony-one/go-sdk.

The script has currently only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 - compatibility with other distros and versions will be added eventually.

### Installation:

```
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/harmony-tools/master/build/build.sh && chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will compile all related harmony and go-sdk/hmy binaries and save them to ~/harmony by default (it's configurable using --path)

You can proceed to copy all of the binaries to a separate directory or run the node from the build directory.

*IMPORTANT*:

If you're using node.sh in conjunction with this custom build you need to pass -D as a parameter to node.sh in order to stop it from downloading and overwriting the binaries, e.g:

```
sudo ./node.sh -D -k bls.key -N dev -i 0
```
