Scripts and tools for Harmony.one

## install/install.sh
install.sh downloads the custom compiled static binaries from Amazon S3. It can also download the latest node.sh from harmony-one/harmony (master) using the flag --node

### Installation/Usage:

Normal release:
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/harmony-tools/master/install/install.sh) --node
```

Staking release:
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/harmony-tools/master/install/install.sh) --staking --node
```

## build/build.sh
build.sh is a custom build script that statically compiles the harmony, bootnode, wallet and hmy binaries using the master branches from harmony-one/harmony and harmony-one/go-sdk.

It also features support for uploading the binaries to Amazon S3.

### Installation:

Normal release:
```
curl -LOs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/harmony-tools/master/build/build.sh && chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Staking t3/release:
```
curl -LOs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianJ/harmony-tools/master/build/build.sh && chmod u+x build.sh
./build.sh --harmony-branch t3
```

This will compile all related harmony and go-sdk/hmy binaries and save them to ~/harmony by default. If you want to change the path where the binaries are copied use `--path YOUR_CUSTOM_PATH`.

You can proceed to copy all of the binaries to a separate directory or run the node from the build directory.

*IMPORTANT*:

If you're using node.sh in conjunction with this custom build you need to pass -D as a parameter to node.sh in order to stop it from downloading and overwriting the binaries, e.g:

```
./node.sh -k bls.key -N staking -z -D -S (or however you want to run, running as sudo or non-sudo etc)
```
